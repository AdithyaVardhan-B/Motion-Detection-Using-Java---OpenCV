# Motion-Detection-Using-Java-And-OpenCV
Java project in Motion Detection Using OpenCV.

Misc maybe useful tips:
* This project uses OpenCV along with Java to take input from webcam of laptop and test for motion.
* The mechanism is simple, it takes a picture from webcam every few miliseconds and compare it with picture taken before it, if any contours are found then there is motion.
* This contours are examined and a green rectangle is drawn on them indicating place of motion.
* The comments are non-existent as I developed it in my 2nd Year of BE and I wasn't professional developer back then.
